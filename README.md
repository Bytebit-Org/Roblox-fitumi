# Fake It 'Till You Make It
Fake It 'Till You Make It, or fitumi, is a Lua faking library intended for helping to create comprehensive unit tests for Lua code bases. While not required, fitumi was designed with Roblox development as the primary use-case. Fitumi's design is inspired in part by [FakeItEasy](https://fakeiteasy.github.io/).

Fitumi comes paired with TypeScript annotation files for easy installation into a roblox-ts project and is published to NPM under the [@rbxts/fitumi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rbxts/fitumi) package.
